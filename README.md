# *lsa*BGC-Pan
*lsa*BGC-Pan - is largely the same lsaBGC package reconfigured for easier installation via both Docker and Bioconda and featuring a simpler workflow bearing the same name. There are some additional new analytical options -e.g. (de-)association testing of BGC ortholog groups and GCFs -, the lsaBGC-(Auto)Expansion functionalities have been taken out, and lsaBGC-PopGene has been replaced with zol.
