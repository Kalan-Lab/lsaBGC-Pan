Main:
- add cgc to zol and as another output visualization
- add phylo heatmap of associated features for each focal GCF found by lsaBGC-Sociate
- switch from multiprocessing to threading to avoid straggling during zol parallelization.
- have only one zol run per GCF - compute conservation for other GCFs manually using a new function.

Other:
- add/move zol-scape and refiner to zol
